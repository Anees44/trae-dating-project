# Public Assets Folder

Place your video files here for use in the Hero component.

## Video Requirements:

1. **File Name**: Name your video file `hero-video.mp4` (or `hero-video.webm` for better compression)
2. **Recommended Format**: 
   - MP4 (H.264 codec) - most compatible
   - WebM - better compression, smaller file size
3. **Recommended Resolution**: 1920x1080 (Full HD) or higher
4. **File Size**: Try to keep it under 10MB for faster loading
5. **Duration**: 10-30 seconds (it will loop automatically)

## Video Tips:

- Use a video that represents your brand/theme
- Ensure the video isn't too busy so text remains readable
- The overlay will help with text readability, but choose videos with appropriate lighting
- Consider using a video compression tool to reduce file size while maintaining quality

## Example:

Place your video file as:
- `public/hero-video.mp4`
- `public/hero-video.webm` (optional, for better browser support)

The Hero component will automatically use these files if they exist.
